This repository contains supplementary information for the manuscript "Nutritional and ecological perspectives of potential microbiome-dependent and microbiome-independent diet effects in multiple sclerosis: insights from marmosets," which has been submitted for peer review.

The R file "marmoset_analysis" contains the code required to reproduce all analyses and figures. The R workspace "marmoset_workspace" has the raw data files uploaded, but raw data files are also provided in a separate folder in this repository.

If you have any questions about the content of these files, please contact Scott Sugden (second author) at ssugden@ualberta.ca or sasugden@gmail.com.
